# Package Overview

This package contains the mediation policy "JSON to XML" which is available out of the box in Choreo. This policy provides the capability to transform 
a request/response with a JSON payload to a request/response with an XML payload.

## Usage

This will be available to select when attaching mediation policies to a proxy in Choreo. This is only applicable to the request flow and response flow mediation 
sequences. There are no policy parameters for this policy. This policy assumes that the request/response payload is JSON. Attempting to use it on a 
request/response with a non-JSON payload will result in premature termination of the mediation flow. For the same reason, this policy cannot be 
attached multiple times to a resource since once it is used, the payload will be an XML value.
